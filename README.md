## ABSTRACT
Gentrification in major urban centers around the world has led to the movement and displacement of tens of millions of people. New York City is no different facing rapid neighborhood change on a yearly basis. While the effects of gentrification have long been studied, the indicators of gentrification are still mired in mystery. Utilizing US Census and NYC PLUTO datasets, this paper generates a model to predict which neighborhoods will see high, medium, or low growth in property values five years in the future. This study builds on existing research by discovering the factors that lead to high and low neighborhood growth rates. Through understanding the factors that lead to soon-to-be high value neighborhoods, as well as those of stagnating neighborhoods, policymakers will be able to develop early interventions to counteract well defined negative impacts and better combat economic inequality in cities.
